# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Background

Roza is a biological researcher in a microbiology laboratory. Roza’s role is to discover and document bacteria species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. She believes that those type of bacteria species can be found in a human belly button. To test her hypotheses, she has sampled the navels of people across the country. Each person’s identity is confidential and is represented in the sample data as an ID. Those who have participated in this research will be able to access a webpage and choose their ID to know which bacteria type lives in their navels.

Roza is building a dashboard that shows a panel for demographic information based on the ID chosen from a drop-down menu. She also added visualization of top 10 bacterial species that live in volunteers belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Project Deliverables

The challenge requires four technical analysis deliverables in order to present a vibrant, dynamic and useful website for volunteers and public to use:

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

### Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

Customizations include:

* Adding a background image to Jumbotron
* Adding background colour to the page
* Changing guage colours to match overall page theme of "blue"
